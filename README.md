# osimplay

My playground for downstream OpenSim C++ integrations/prototypes

**DO NOT USE**: The code in here is going to be very hacky, not
designed for downstream integration, and probably not working. The
main reason this repo exists is so that I have something to URL link
to when talking about bugs, prototypes, etc.
